		<h3>The article given to us there reads thus:</h3>
		<article class="article">
			<p class="first-paragraph">Coming down to the house late that night, we figured out thst the men in the house were all hidden in the bathroom.Knowing fully well that we were coming, they locked the window and allowed us to cross by without telling us to join them in the room. That got us furiated and we did niot hesitate to start a fight.</p>
			<p>On seeing us, the <i>women</i> among them told us to waut behind the shores in the <a class="word"><strong>red</strong></a> and asked us if we had the required tables of each of the kings' demand and we replied no to them all as we did not have any of them. As time went on, we called on the main host of the event and told him that we were done and ready to go and he happily bid us good bye. And that was how we won the midnight game and all that. So we had no choice but to go back to the main host's house and tell him how we had executed our assignments. He congratuolated us and gave us USD10,000.00 each and we smiled home individually.</p>
